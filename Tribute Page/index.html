                <p>
                    Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore FRAS (/rəˈbɪndrənɑːt tæˈɡɔːr/ (listen); Bengali: রবীন্দ্রনাথ ঠাকুর pronounced 
                    ˈbindɾɔnatʰ ˈʈʰakuɾ]; 7 May 1861 – 7 August 1941) was a Bengali polymath who worked as a poet, writer,
                    playwright, composer, philosopher, social reformer and painter. He reshaped Bengali literature and
                    music as well as Indian art with Contextual Modernism in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Author of the
                    "profoundly sensitive, fresh and beautiful" poetry of Gitanjali, he became in 1913 the first non-European
                    and the first lyricist to win the Nobel Prize in Literature. Tagore's poetic songs were viewed as spiritual and
                    mercurial; however, his "elegant prose and magical poetry" remain largely unknown outside Bengal. He
                    was a fellow of the Royal Asiatic Society. Referred to as "the Bard of Bengal", Tagore was known by
                    sobriquets: Gurudeb, Kobiguru, Biswokobi.

                <h2><u>Works</u></h2>
                <p>
                    Known mostly for his poetry, Tagore wrote novels, essays, short stories, travelogues, dramas, and thousands of songs. Of Tagore's prose, his short stories
                    are perhaps most highly regarded; he is indeed credited with originating the Bengali-language version of the genre. His works are frequently noted for their
                    rhythmic, optimistic, and lyrical nature. Such stories mostly borrow from the lives of common people. Tagore's non-fiction grappled with history, linguistics,
                    and spirituality. He wrote autobiographies. His travelogues, essays, and lectures were compiled into several volumes, including Europe Jatrir Patro (Letters
                    from Europe) and Manusher Dhormo (The Religion of Man). His brief chat with Einstein, "Note on the Nature of Reality", is included as an appendix to the
                    latter. On the occasion of Tagore's 150th birthday, an anthology (titled Kalanukromik Rabindra Rachanabali) of the total body of his works is currently being
                    published in Bengali in chronological order. This includes all versions of each work and fills about eighty volumes.[103] In 2011, Harvard University Press
                    collaborated with Visva-Bharati University to publish The Essential Tagore, the largest anthology of Tagore's works available in English; it was edited by
                    Fakrul Alam and Radha Chakravarthy and marks the 150th anniversary of Tagore's birth.
